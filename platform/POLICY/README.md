# Policy Placeholders

- `security.md` — to be authored by the Security & Compliance agent with scanning requirements and secret-handling policies.
- `licensing.md` — track third-party license obligations.
- `pii.md` — define personal-data handling rules (likely minimal for Tic-Tac-Toe MVP).

Populate these files as soon as the corresponding agents run. Do not leave policies undefined once external services or user data are introduced.
