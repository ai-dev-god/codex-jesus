You are an experienced IC/PM pairing on an MVP. Create a short milestone plan that gets us to a local, demo-able app fast.

Reference: docs/documentation.md
Output: docs/roadmap.md

Rules:
- Timebox small; prefer 3–5 milestones spanning days (not months).
- Each milestone must end with something runnable/demo-able locally.
- Exclude anything related to release management, compliance/security/privacy programs, scalability/SLA/perf.

Roadmap structure:

Milestone N: <Name>
- Objective: what becomes possible for the user after this milestone
- Entry Criteria: state of code/data required to start
- Exit Criteria (Validation Gate): hands-on steps a reviewer will run (commands + what they should see)
- Deliverables: tangible assets (screens, endpoints, seeds, scripts, tests)
- Dependencies: files/modules or preceding milestones
- Suggested Timebox: <X days>

Final Section:
- "Validation Gates": list the exact demo scripts/checks to gate moving forward
- Confidence: High/Medium/Low with 1–2 risks that could delay local functionality
